# Installation

This framework contains several sub-packages that you don’t necessarily need. It is highly recommended to install what you need and not the whole framework.

The preferred way to install the library you need is to use composer:

```text
composer require spomky-labs/web-push-lib
```

Hereafter the available packages:

* `spomky-labs/web-push-lib`: this is the core library. This package can be used in any PHP project or within any popular framework \(Laravel, CakePHP…\)
* `spomky-labs/web-push-bundle`: this is a Symfony bundle that ease the integration of this authentication mechanism in your Symfony project.
